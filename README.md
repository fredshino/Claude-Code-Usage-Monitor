A lightweight, open-source Windows taskbar widget for monitoring Claude Code usage limits and reset times. It can also display usage for Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, and Cursor.

## Features

- Displays current usage and time remaining until each limit resets
- Counts usage up from zero or down from the full allowance, whichever you prefer
- Supports Claude Code, Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, and Cursor
- Supports multiple accounts for Claude Code and Codex
- Lives in the Windows taskbar with quick controls in the system tray
- Supports multiple monitors and Windows startup
- Includes configurable refresh intervals, providers, languages, and updates
- Provides built-in themes and a visual Theme Studio for custom layouts
- Collects no analytics or telemetry

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- At least one supported provider installed and signed in

Claude Code credentials can be detected from the CLI, Claude desktop app, or WSL. Other providers are optional and can be enabled independently from the dashboard.

## Installation

Install the latest release with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install CodeZeno.ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor
```

Alternatively, download `claude-code-usage-monitor.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/releases).

## Usage

Start the monitor:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor
```

Open the settings dashboard directly:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --dashboard
```

Use the dashboard to select providers, change the refresh interval, choose a display, enable startup, or customize the widget. **Settings > Display > Usage direction** switches the default theme and other themes that support this setting between showing what has been used and what is left, with Used as the default. Selecting Remaining makes a fresh limit read 100% and drain as you work.

Theme authors can opt in with `.display` bindings, including `{claude.session.display:usage_line}` and `{claude.session.display:usage_badge}`. Existing `.percentage`, `.remaining`, and unsuffixed usage summaries keep their meaning; warning thresholds should continue to use `.percentage`.

In the default theme, left-click a provider tray icon to show or hide the widget and right-click it to open the menu.

## Provider setup

| Provider | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Sign in with the Claude Code CLI or desktop app. Windows and WSL credentials are detected automatically. |
| Codex | Install and sign in to the Codex CLI, then enable Codex in **Providers**. |
| Google Antigravity | Sign in to Antigravity, then enable it in **Providers**. |
| OpenCode Go | Connect an OpenCode Go account, configure the credentials described below, then enable OpenCode in **Providers**. |
| Cursor | Sign in to Cursor, then enable it in **Providers**. The local session is detected automatically. |

For OpenCode Go, set `OPENCODE_GO_WORKSPACE_ID` and `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE`, or create `%APPDATA%\opencode-go\config.json`:

```json
{
  "workspaceId": "wrk_01...",
  "authCookie": "__Host-console_session=your-session-cookie-value"
}
```

The workspace ID is part of the OpenCode Go console URL: `https://opencode.ai/console/<workspaceId>/go`. Copy the `__Host-console_session` cookie from an authenticated `opencode.ai` browser session, including its name as shown above. A full Cookie header containing `__Host-console_session` or the legacy `auth` cookie is also accepted unchanged; no empty `auth=;` prefix is needed. Bare legacy `auth` cookie values remain supported. These formats work for both `authCookie` and `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE`. Set `OPENCODE_GO_CONFIG_FILE` to use a different config path. The monitor reads usage from the console JSON API using this workspace ID and cookie.

For Cursor, `CURSOR_SESSION_TOKEN` can override the automatically detected local session.

### Several Codex accounts with codex-multi-auth

If the Codex CLI is managed by [codex-multi-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codex-multi-auth), the monitor picks up every account saved in its pool (`~/.codex/multi-auth/openai-codex-accounts.json`, or the same path under `CODEX_HOME`) and lists them under **Accounts** in the dashboard, named by email. Nothing is written back to the pool: the wrapper keeps refreshing the tokens, and the monitor only reads the current access token when it polls. An account whose token the wrapper has not refreshed yet shows an authentication error until the wrapper next uses it.

Right-click the widget and open **Codex account** to choose which account the widget shows. **Follow the Codex CLI** keeps it on whatever account you last switched to with `codex-multi-auth switch`; picking an account by name pins it. The same choice is available as **Default account** in the dashboard. Custom themes can show every account at once through the `accounts.codex.<id>` bindings, and custom context menus can use `select_account(codex, "<id>")` or `select_account(codex, *)`.

## Data and privacy

The monitor reads local sign-in credentials for enabled providers and sends usage requests directly to their official services. It has no backend service, collects no telemetry, and does not upload credentials or project files.

Credentials are read without modifying the provider files that contain them. OpenCode Go credentials saved in a JSON configuration file are plain text and should be protected like a browser session cookie.

## Troubleshooting

Run diagnostics with:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --diagnose
```

The diagnostic log is written to `%TEMP%\claude-code-usage-monitor.log`. Application settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json`.

## Build from source

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.95 or later, then run:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be created at `target\release\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe`.
